ULTRAKILLing in VR is now a thing.  
This mod exists because [HuskVR](https://github.com/TeamDoodz/HuskVR) is not being updated for like 7 months, so I was like "Fine, I'll do it myself".  
Also it does not require any other mods to function.  

## Features
### What works right now:
It'll be much easier to describe what **doesn't** work.
### What doesn't work right now:
- Accessibility stuff. (e.g. left-handed mode)
- 4-S, 5-S.
- VRAvatar's legs.
### Planned stuff:
**1.0**: Full release (when i think that nothing more can be done)  
**1.x.x**: Mods compatibility (JAKET, ultraballing, etc.) (angry level loader works) (dab me up ![xzxADIxzx](https://github.com/xzxADIxzx))  
**Future**: Maintenance updates  
...and a separate UI for config edit, setup, uninstall and updating, since such actions might get complicated.

**Additional info (such as installation, common problems, default bindings, etc.) has moved to the [Wiki](https://github.com/whateverusername0/VRTRAKILL/wiki)**
