ULTRAKILLing in VR is now a thing.  
This mod exists because [HuskVR](https://github.com/TeamDoodz/HuskVR) was not being updated for a whole year, so I was like "Fine, I'll do it myself".  
Also it does not require any other mods to function.  

## Features
### What works right now:
It'll be much easier to describe what **doesn't** work.
### What doesn't work right now:
- Accessibility stuff. (e.g. left-handed mode)
- 4-S.
### Planned stuff:
**1.0**: Full release (when i think that nothing more can be done)  
**1.x.x**: Mods compatibility (JAKET, ultraballing, etc.)
**Future**: Maintenance updates  
...and a separate UI for config edit, setup, uninstalling and updating.
